# DataHub
> The data science hub for students at SUSTech.

DataHub is an interdisciplinary students' organization that promotes data science across both the SUSTech community and out city Shenzhen. Our mission is to help students connect with each other, academics, and industry; learn the tools, techniques, and reality of data science; and practice their skills.

## Motivation
- Students: Learn more knowledge at school, but lack an opportunity to apply it in solving real-life problems.
- Start-ups: Brave to innovations, but lack the people or money to do data analytics.
- Shenzhen: A young and thriving city with innovative start-ups.
